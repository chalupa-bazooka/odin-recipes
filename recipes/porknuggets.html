    <p>Damn, it's so delicious! It also scares off local muslims so you'll have more nuggets to enjoy without sharing with anyone!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pork</li>
        <li>Breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Oven that can go really hot (like hell)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Just buy a pack of frozen nuggets and that's it</li>
        <li>Alternatively, slice a piece of pork and put breadcrumbs around each slice</li>
        <li>Cool, now put it into an oven for 5 hours</li>
        <li>Damn, I said 5 hours? I meant 30 minutes</li>
        <li>Well, whatever. Eat them all now</li>
        <li>I know where you live</li>
    </ol>
